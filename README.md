# flight_ticket_booking_app

A new Flutter application.
A flutter App that allows user to book for a trip and a trip token will be sent to the user.
The sent token is what the user will use to check the details of his/her trip.
GetX state management is used in this app.
The App is connected to a Backend that I developed with Java Spring boot.
